### Step 4: Generate GitLab SSH Keys & Clone Installer Backend Projects
- **Description**: Automates the creation of a GitLab-compatible SSH key, uploads it via GitLab's API using your Personal Access Token (PAT), configures your SSH client for seamless access, and offers to clone all repositories under SolarEdge‚Äôs `cloud-sw/installer/backend` group.
- **Purpose**: This step ensures secure, password-less Git access over SSH, improves Git workflow automation, and instantly sets up your local development environment with all backend repositories.
- **Special Notes**:
  - üîê You‚Äôll need to provide a [GitLab Personal Access Token](https://gitlab.solaredge.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) with `api` and `write_repository` scopes.
  - üåê Ensure you are connected to the **SolarEdge VPN** when running this step, as GitLab access requires VPN connectivity if you're not on-site.
  - üìÅ Repositories are cloned to `~/git_projects` by default, but you can specify a different directory during the process.
